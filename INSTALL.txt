Installing Django Shortcodes
----------------------------

If you're running a UNIX system, the best thing to do
is to create a symbolic link from the site-packages directory
of your Python installation to the shortcodes directory. That
way, as you download new shortcodes they'll instantly be
available to all of the projects using the django-shortcodes
app.
